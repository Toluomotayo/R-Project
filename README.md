# 📊 R Projects: BMI Web App | Expenses Analysis | Web Scraping  
This repository contains three beginner-to-intermediate level R projects demonstrating real-world applications of data analysis and interactive dashboards using R and its ecosystem of libraries. Projects include a BMI calculator web app, personal expenses visual analysis, and web scraping of company revenue data from Wikipedia.

## 📈 Project 1: BMI Web App  

An interactive **Body Mass Index (BMI)** calculator built using **Shiny R**, designed to take user input for height and weight and return the calculated BMI along with classification ranges. Although unpublished online, the app is fully functional on a local R environment.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **R** – programming language  
- **Shiny** – for building web apps  
- **RStudio** – for development and testing  

---

## 💻 How It Works  
- Accepts **height and weight inputs** from the user  
- Calculates **BMI** and categorizes results (underweight, normal, overweight, etc.)  
- Built with a clean and intuitive user interface  

---

## 🔧 Installation & Usage  
1. Install **R** and **Shiny**  
2. Open `BMI_app.R` in **RStudio** or any IDE supporting R  
3. Run the script to launch the local web app  
4. A screenshot of the app interface is included in the repository

## 📈 Project 2: Monthly Expenses Analysis  

This project analyzes personal **monthly expenditure** data using **R** and visual libraries like `ggplot2` and `plotly`. The data was slightly modified and sourced during a course.

---

## 📊 Visualization Highlights  
- **Column Chart** – Created using `ggplot2` to show spending trends across categories  
- **Pie Chart** – Built with `plotly` to visualize proportional spending  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **R + RStudio** – for data handling  
- **readxl** – to read Excel files  
- **ggplot2** – for static column charts  
- **plotly** – for interactive pie chart visualizations  

---

## 💻 How It Works  
- Reads Excel file with spending data  
- Cleans and transforms the dataset  
- Visualizes insights through pie and column charts  
- Saved images of visuals included in the project folder  

---

## 🌐 Project 3: Web Scraping – Top European Companies by Revenue  

This project scrapes data from Wikipedia’s **List of Largest Companies in Europe by Revenue** using the `rvest` library. It extracts and transforms the **second table** on the page into a structured dataset.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **R** – for scripting  
- **rvest** – for web scraping  
- **dplyr** – for data wrangling  
- **readr** – for saving output as CSV  

---

## 💻 How It Works  
1. Fetches table data from Wikipedia  
2. Cleans and structures the dataset  
3. Exports results to a CSV file  
4. CSV can be further explored using Excel, R, or BI tools  

---

## 🚀 What I Achieved  
- Built a **functional BMI calculator app** in R using Shiny  
- Visualized **real-world financial data** with `ggplot2` and `plotly`  
- Gained hands-on experience in **web scraping with rvest**  
- Enhanced knowledge of **data storytelling** with R
